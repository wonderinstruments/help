# Using the Python Interpreter {#tut-using}

## Invoking the Interpreter {#tut-invoking}

The Python interpreter is usually installed as [\|usr_local_bin_python_x_dot_y_literal\|](##SUBST##|usr_local_bin_python_x_dot_y_literal|) on those machines where it is available; putting `/usr/local/bin`{.interpreted-text role="file"} in your Unix shell\'s search path makes it possible to start it by typing the command:

``` text
python3.16
```

to the shell.[^1] Since the choice of the directory where the interpreter lives is an installation option, other places are possible; check with your local Python guru or system administrator. (E.g., `/usr/local/python`{.interpreted-text role="file"} is a popular alternative location.)

On Windows machines where you have installed Python from the `Microsoft Store
<windows-store>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, the [\|python_x_dot_y_literal\|](##SUBST##|python_x_dot_y_literal|) command will be available. If you have the `py.exe launcher <launcher>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} installed, you can use the `py`{.interpreted-text role="file"} command. See `setting-envvars`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for other ways to launch Python.

Typing an end-of-file character (`Control-D`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"} on Unix, `Control-Z`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"} on Windows) at the primary prompt causes the interpreter to exit with a zero exit status. If that doesn\'t work, you can exit the interpreter by typing the following command: `quit()`.

The interpreter\'s line-editing features include interactive editing, history substitution and code completion on most systems. Perhaps the quickest check to see whether command line editing is supported is typing a word in on the Python prompt, then pressing Left arrow (or `Control-b`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"}). If the cursor moves, you have command line editing; see Appendix `tut-interacting`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for an introduction to the keys. If nothing appears to happen, or if a sequence like `^[[D` or `^B` appears, command line editing isn\'t available; you\'ll only be able to use backspace to remove characters from the current line.

The interpreter operates somewhat like the Unix shell: when called with standard input connected to a tty device, it reads and executes commands interactively; when called with a file name argument or with a file as standard input, it reads and executes a *script* from that file.

A second way of starting the interpreter is `python -c command [arg] ...`, which executes the statement(s) in *command*, analogous to the shell\'s `-c`{.interpreted-text role="option"} option. Since Python statements often contain spaces or other characters that are special to the shell, it is usually advised to quote *command* in its entirety.

Some Python modules are also useful as scripts. These can be invoked using `python -m module [arg] ...`, which executes the source file for *module* as if you had spelled out its full name on the command line.

When a script file is used, it is sometimes useful to be able to run the script and enter interactive mode afterwards. This can be done by passing `-i`{.interpreted-text role="option"} before the script.

All command line options are described in `using-on-general`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

### Argument Passing {#tut-argpassing}

When known to the interpreter, the script name and additional arguments thereafter are turned into a list of strings and assigned to the `argv` variable in the `sys` module. You can access this list by executing `import sys`. The length of the list is at least one; when no script and no arguments are given, `sys.argv[0]` is an empty string. When the script name is given as `'-'` (meaning standard input), `sys.argv[0]` is set to `'-'`. When `-c`{.interpreted-text role="option"} *command* is used, `sys.argv[0]` is set to `'-c'`. When `-m`{.interpreted-text role="option"} *module* is used, `sys.argv[0]` is set to the full name of the located module. Options found after `-c`{.interpreted-text role="option"} *command* or `-m`{.interpreted-text role="option"} *module* are not consumed by the Python interpreter\'s option processing but left in `sys.argv` for the command or module to handle.

### Interactive Mode {#tut-interactive}

When commands are read from a tty, the interpreter is said to be in *interactive mode*. In this mode it prompts for the next command with the *primary prompt*, usually three greater-than signs (`>>>`); for continuation lines it prompts with the *secondary prompt*, by default three dots (`...`). The interpreter prints a welcome message stating its version number and a copyright notice before printing the first prompt:

``` shell-session
$ python3.16
Python 3.16 (default, May 7 2026, 19:03:04)
[GCC 10.2.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

Continuation lines are needed when entering a multi-line construct. As an example, take a look at this `if`{.interpreted-text role="keyword"} statement:

    >>> the_world_is_flat = True
    >>> if the_world_is_flat:
    ...     print("Be careful not to fall off!")
    ...
    Be careful not to fall off!

For more on interactive mode, see `tut-interac`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

## The Interpreter and Its Environment {#tut-interp}

### Source Code Encoding {#tut-source-encoding}

By default, Python source files are treated as encoded in UTF-8. In that encoding, characters of most languages in the world can be used simultaneously in string literals, identifiers and comments \-\-- although the standard library only uses ASCII characters for identifiers, a convention that any portable code should follow. To display all these characters properly, your editor must recognize that the file is UTF-8, and it must use a font that supports all the characters in the file.

To declare an encoding other than the default one, a special comment line should be added as the *first* line of the file. The syntax is as follows:

    # -*- coding: encoding -*-

where *encoding* is one of the valid `codecs`{.interpreted-text role="mod"} supported by Python.

For example, to declare that Windows-1252 encoding is to be used, the first line of your source code file should be:

    # -*- coding: cp1252 -*-

One exception to the *first line* rule is when the source code starts with a `UNIX "shebang" line <tut-scripts>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. In this case, the encoding declaration should be added as the second line of the file. For example:

    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    # -*- coding: cp1252 -*-

**Footnotes**

[^1]: On Unix, the Python 3.x interpreter is by default not installed with the executable named `python`, so that it does not conflict with a simultaneously installed Python 2.x executable.
